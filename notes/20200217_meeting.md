# RAP levels task and finish group - 17/02/20
In attendance: Anna Price, Alex Newton, Ciara Gribbon, Seb Fox, Jamie Lendrum

# Summary of discussion

## 1. Why do we need RAP levels/a RAP MVP?

We need a shared understanding of what RAP is among analysts/statisticians/data scientists and their managers in order to:
- reassure them that RAP is achievable and give confidence to those who haven't created a RAP before
- help them understand what steps need to be taken to build a RAP
- provide assurance/confirmation of a RAP once it has been completed

## 2. What are the benefits of RAP?

We agreed that the biggest benefits of RAP are:
- Better business continuity/knowledge management 
- Improved quality (minimising risk of error and being able to better spot and fix errors)
- Increased trust of the process and outputs by producers, their managers and users
- More efficient processes (including department-wide working)

Other benefits of RAP include: 
- Better quality assurance (e.g. by standardising practices)
- Improved timeliness
- New skills learned by producers and greater confidence in these skills

## 3. What does a RAP need to realise these main benefits?

### Business continuity: 
- documentation embedded within the product
- well-commented code
- a guarunteed audit trail of changes over time

### Improved quality: 
- no manual steps (in the part of the process selected for RAP)
- peer review of code
- testing (*unclear how prescreptive we want to be here*)

### Increased trust:

### More efficient processes:
