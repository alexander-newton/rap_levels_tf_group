# RAP Benefits

A RAP should:
- Improve the quality of the statistics.
- Increase trust in the statistics by producers, their managers and users.
- Create a more efficient process.
- Improve business continuity and knowledge management.

# RAP MVP

In order to achieve these benefits, at a minimum a RAP must:
- Contain **no manual steps** and carry out **no processing in spreadsheets**. 
- Be built using **open source software** which is available to anyone.
- Guarantee an **audit trail** using version control software.
- Be **open to anyone** within a department, and publicly if appropriate. This can be facilitated most easily through the use of file and code sharing platforms.
- Contain **well-commented** code and have **documentation embedded** within the product, rather than saved elsewhere.
- Be **peer reviewed**, by building the RAP collaboratively and/or via a one-off review if this is not possible.
- Be **tested**.

Notes:
- It is acknowledged that there may be restrictions which stop statistics producers building a RAP for their full end-to-end process. In this case, the above requirements apply to the selected part of the process.
- Using spreadsheets for input or output data is fine.
- There is not a specific tool that is required to build a RAP, but both R and python provide the power and flexibility to carry out end-to-end analytical processes, from data source to final presentation.
