# RAP Levels, Principles and Pathways
Repo for the RAP Levels, Principles and Pathways Task &amp; Finish Group

We agreed to start a Task and Finish Group to approach this problem with the following steers:
- To review the existing RAP levels and principles from various departments and synthesise these into a RAP ‘minimum viable product’ with optional ‘added extras’ which can improve a RAP further.
- To develop a learning pathway framework so that analysts can know what they need to learn next.
- To present a proposal for the RAP ‘levels’ at the next RAP champions meet up for discussion.
